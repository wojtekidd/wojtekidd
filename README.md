### Hi (ãƒŽ^âˆ‡^)

My name is Wojtek (pronounced vÉ”Éªtek or `voitech`)

During the day I work with software developers and product people, taking care of products, communication, clients, and communities. 

Currently at [Akuity](https://akuity.io). 

I was a part of such companies as Mudita, Sphere Engine, Semaphore CI, CKSource (makers of CKEditor) and the British Council.

When I'm not hanging out with my family I'm trying to [write and record](https://wojtekidd.org) some rap/spoken word pieces.
